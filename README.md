# STUDENT_GRADE_ANALYSIS
The objective of this project is to create a program that analyzes the grades of students in a class. The program should allow the user to enter the grades of each student and then perform various analyses on the data, such as calculating the class average, finding the highest and lowest grades, and determining how many students passed or failed.
